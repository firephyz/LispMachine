<H1><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC49">6  Standard procedures</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes Scheme's built-in procedures.  The initial (or "top
level") Scheme environment starts out with a number of variables bound to
locations containing useful values, most of which are primitive procedures that
manipulate data.  For example, the variable abs is bound to (a location
initially containing) a procedure of one argument that computes the absolute
value of a number, and the variable + is bound to a procedure that computes
sums.  Built-in procedures that can easily be written in terms of other
built-in procedures are identified as "library procedures".

</P>
<P>
A program may use a top-level definition to bind any variable.  It may
subsequently alter any such binding by an assignment (see 4.1.6).  These
operations do not modify the behavior of Scheme's built-in procedures.
Altering any top-level binding that has not been introduced by a definition has
an unspecified effect on the behavior of the built-in procedures.
